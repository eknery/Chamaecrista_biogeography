# Historical biogeography of neotropical Chamaecrista

### Description:
This repository has the data and code used in the article **From rainforests to open-vegetation: The biogeographic history of Chamaecrista (Leguminosae) in the Neotropics**.
The article

1. initial_sequences: 
    1. The aligned DNA sequences of five loci sequenced from *Chamaecrista* species and allies;
    
2. sequence_evaluation: 
    1. The best-fitting substitution models for five loci sequenced from *Chamaecrista* species and allies
    2. The bootstrap maximum-likelihood (ML) trees inferred for five loci sequenced from *Chamaecrista* species and allies;
    3. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) comparing the topology of the bootstrap ML trees;

3. final_sequences:
    1. The aligned DNA sequences of five loci sequenced from *Chamaecrista* species and allies, with blank lines added for non-sequenced species;
    2. The concatenated DNA sequences of of five loci sequenced from *Chamaecrista* species and allies;
    
4. iqtree:
    1. The ML tree inferred for the concatenated DNA sequences;
    2. The ML tree inferred for the concatenated DNA sequences, but only with the high-support nodes (bootstrap values > 90%);

5. posterior:
    1. The Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree inferred for five loci sequenced from *Chamaecrista* species and allies;
